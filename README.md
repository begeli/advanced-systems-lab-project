# Collision Detection: The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi Algorithm and Bounding Volume Hierarchies 

We present optimized implementations of two 3D collision detection algorithms:  The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi Algorithm (GJK) and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH). Previous papers consider only the speedup from simplifying GJK to perform intersection tests on convex shapes. Our contribution is to use SIMD vectorizations and other optimizations to achieve a speedup of 13.5 times. BVH extends collision detection to general shapes. Our choice of k-DOP Bounding Volume (BV) quad trees allows efficient SIMD parallel intersection tests. Combined with half-precision floats we increased performance by up to 8.4 times compared to baseline.

## Results

* We have managed to achieve a maximum speedup of 13.5 for GJK.
* We have managed to achieve a maximum speedup of 2.45 for BVH. 

## Files and Folders
* [`14_report.pdf`](https://github.com/begeli/advanced-systems-lab-project/blob/main/14_report.pdf): This file is the final version of our report. It contains brief explanations of the algorithms of interest, detailed explanations of the optimization methods we applied and our experimental results.
* `src`: This folder contains full implementations of the algorithms and optimized versions.
* `test`: This folder contains our unit test cases for the algorithms. 
* `benchmarking`: This folder contains the code used to measure execution times of the various implementations.

## Project Setup

Currently only importing into CLion is confirmed to work.
Running CMake directly (passing the desired C and C++ compiler flags explicitly) should probably also work.

## For CLion
Open the outer folder in CLion as a project. Setup any Profile under `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `CMake`, passing the desired Compiler Flags (such as target architecture) as CMake options.

For now the C compiler flags are: `-std=c11 -O3 -march=[MACHINE ARCHITECTURE] -mprefer-vector-width=512 -ffast-math`.

`[MACHINE ARCHITECTURE]` can be:
* `skylake-avx512` (for the rented `Intel Xeon D-2141I CPU` bare metal server) for BVH
* `icelake` (`Intel Core i7-1068NG7`) for GJK

The C++ flags are analogous.

## Testing
### Using GoogleTest 
The `test` folder contains all tests.
Tests are compiled in C++ using the `GoogleTest` library. They test the GJK and BVH code, which was written and compiled in C.

The tests can also be run from CLion conveniently, like unit tests in Java with JUnit.
(Note: you will have to build the `gjk` target, before building and running the `tester` target).
